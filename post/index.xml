      <description>The 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of algorithms to classify heart sound recordings collected from a variety of clinical or nonclinical (such as in-home visits) environments. The aim is to identify, from a single short recording (10-60s) from a single precordial location, whether the subject of the recording should be referred on for an expert diagnosis.

      <description>This is a project on skin cancer detection web app which has been implemented with flask framework and deployed on Heroku. The model has been built using fastai deep learning library which is a high level api for pytorch. The classifier has been trained using skin dataset collected from google and loaded to Kaggle which contains 400 images of three categories of pigmented skin lesions. The classifier has been built with transfer learning technique using a pretrained Densenet169 model.</description>

  Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
  The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.</description>
